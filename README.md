# 7-3-Project-Three
This project was made to group and display the amount of times a object showed up in a txt file.
While this was my first time working with maps i feel as though i implimented it fairly well into my code.
One thing i could work on in my code would be my naming as i like PascalCase for naming but there are some inconsistancys.
As to where i can enhance my code im not completly sure as i learned new methods while coding this to make it as efficient as i possible could, so i would have to learn more advanced c++ techniques to be able to judge my current self
the hardest part i had to write was the begining, i have trouble looking at a blank screen as my mind is racing though all the possible ways this can be done in the quickest most efficient way.
skills that i've obtained in this project is some proficiency in iterators and maps, since i used both of these skills the code is very adaptable so changes in the txt file wont cause much of a issue.
